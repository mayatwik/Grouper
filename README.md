After you sign up, you get to the home page, where you can easily see all the events that are coming, every event is displayed and described on an individual card, you can see that on the left side, there is the title of the event and the description, with a green big button you can click and register.
On the right side of the card, there is a photo that the creator of the event added, if you will try to hover over the photo you see that a black screen covers the photo shown with all the other details of the event, like the hour, date, location, price (if there is any), limit (if there is any) and another. In addition, you see that there is a black button named creator, which you can click on and reach the profile page of the creator of that website.

This brings me to the profile page:
The profile page is a page where you can see the details of the person that has created the event, and order!
 in a way that shows the name of that person, the location, gender, photo, and bio.

Creating the events:
Every user can create their events simply and quickly, by replying to a couple of details questions and adding a photo of the event.

After you have created your event, you can check it on "my events" when you click on it, it opens a page where you can see all of the events you have created, in the same way as on the homepage - in cards. But in "my events" you can delete the event you've created, or you can see all of the people who have registered for your event: organized on a big table, where you can see the name of the person, the phone number, the email, and gender.

Now, supposed you've registered for an event and now you want to cancel because of every reason, you can easily do it without any problem, just go to the "registers" tag and click on it, then you would find all of the events you registered for and a delete button too. Just click on it, and your problem is solved.

Other:
- When you create a new event, you can add a limit of people, and when it reaches the limit, it prevents people for register.
- On the home page, there are going to display events that you have already registered for, and could recognize them by the look at the register button, if it's green and writing on it "register": you have not registered for the event yet. But if the button is blue, and there is on it "I can't wait" you have successfully registered for the event. And if it si your event you would see "details" button, which will display you a table of the registers.
